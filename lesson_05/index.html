              Ukraine is a country of breathtaking landscapes, rich history, and
              warm-hearted people. Located in Eastern Europe, it is the largest
              country on the continent. The capital city, Kyiv, is an ancient
              and vibrant metropolis where modernity meets deep-rooted
              traditions. One of the things that make Ukraine unique is its
              incredible nature. The country is covered with golden wheat
              fields, the Carpathian Mountains fascinate with their landscapes
              and picturesque forests, and the Black Sea coast is a place you
              want to return to again and again. Each region has its own charm:
              from the historic centre of Lviv to the long and vibrant
              embankments of Odesa.Ukrainian culture is diverse and full of
              life. Folk songs and dances reflect the spirit of the people,
              while traditional crafts like embroidery and pottery have been
              passed down through generations. The vyshyvanka, a

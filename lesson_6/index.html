        Ukraine is a country of breathtaking landscapes, rich history, and
        warm-hearted people. Located in Eastern Europe, it is the largest
        country on the continent. The capital city, Kyiv, is an ancient and
        vibrant metropolis where modernity meets deep-rooted traditions. One of
        the things that make Ukraine unique is its incredible nature. The
        country is covered with golden wheat fields, the Carpathian Mountains
        fascinate with their landscapes and picturesque forests, and the Black
        Sea coast is a place you want to return to again and again. Each region
        has its own charm: from the historic centre of Lviv to the long and
        vibrant embankments of Odesa. Ukrainian culture is diverse and full of
        life. Folk songs and dances reflect the spirit of the people, while
        traditional crafts like embroidery and pottery have been passed down
        through generations. The vyshyvanka, a hand-embroidered shirt, is a true
        symbol of national identity. Ukrainians are known for their hospitality
        and resilience. Despite challenges, they cherish their freedom and
        traditions, celebrating life with music, festivals, and delicious
        cuisine. Traditional Ukrainian dishes that win hearts are borsch and
        varenyky.

              Mountains fascinate with their landscapes and picturesque forests, and
              the Black Sea coast is a place you want to return to again and again.
              Each region has its own charm: from the historic centre of Lviv to the
              long and vibrant embankments of Odesa. Ukrainian culture is diverse and
              full of life. Folk songs and dances reflect the spirit of the people,
              while traditional crafts like embroidery and pottery have been passed
              down through generations. The vyshyvanka, a hand-embroidered shirt, is a
              true symbol of national identity. Ukrainians are known for their
              hospitality and resilience. Despite challenges, they cherish their
              freedom and traditions, celebrating life with music, festivals, and
              delicious cuisine. Traditional Ukrainian dishes that win hearts are
              borsch and varenyky.

              ancient and vibrant metropolis where modernity meets deep-rooted
              traditions. One of the things that make Ukraine unique is its incredible
              nature. The country is covered with golden wheat fields, the Carpathian
              Mountains fascinate with their landscapes and picturesque forests, and
              the Black Sea coast is a place you want to return to again and again.
